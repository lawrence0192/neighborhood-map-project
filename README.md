Once you do, you'll see a map of the neighborhood in which I live.
It's a pretty quiet neighborhood and most of the fancy establishments are about 30 minutes away, but quiet works 
for me.
However, the map will show establishments that are in the area. 
A list of these places will also be displayed on the right side of the screen, and each place is represented on the
map with a blue map marker.
If you click the blue map marker, the location's name will appear in a box on the screen.  
Also, if you click on a location in the list, the corresponding info will also appear in a box on the screen.
In the top left corner there is a search box that will allow you to search for one of the locations in the list box or any location that can be found on Google Maps.
If you type a location into the search box and hit enter, the map markers on the screen will be filtered to show only the locations you type, and not the pre-populated list.
